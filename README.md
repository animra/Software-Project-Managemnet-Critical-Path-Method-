Software Project Managemnt (Critical Path Method)
I considered my project (Anomaly Detection in Electrocardiogram Signals based on Deep Learning Network) and formulated network model using CPM Conventions. 
(Note: You can use your project and if you simply follow my document you will able to formulate network model using CPM)
a.	Performed Forward Pass 
b.	Provided CPM network diagram after forward pass
c.	Provided Activity Table after forward pass
d.	Performed Backward Pass 
e.	Provided CPM network diagram after backward pass
f.	Provided Activity Table after backward pass
g.	Identified Critical Path and drew a critical path diagram
