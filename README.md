**Software Project Management (Critical Path Method)**

I considered my project **(Anomaly Detection in Electrocardiogram Signals based on Deep Learning Network)** and formulated network model using CPM Conventions. 
(Note: You can use your project and if you simply follow my document you will able to formulate network model using CPM)

* Performed Forward Pass 
* Provided CPM network diagram after forward pass
* Provided Activity Table after forward pass
* Performed Backward Pass 
* Provided CPM network diagram after backward pass
* Provided Activity Table after backward pass
*Identified Critical Path and drew a critical path diagram

Note: **I used Microsoft Project Managemnet**
